# SGD285-1
This repository holds the assignments for Topic 1 of SGD285 course at CPCC.

## Objective 1

1. Clone the repository into a local working directory (DO NOT FORK THE PROJECT)
2. In this scenario, upstream does not exist. You are directly working with a single repository.
3. Modify Main.cs to include your name and your favorite quote as demonstrated by the very first line of the array
4. Add, and Commit your changes with a proper commit message
5. Push to the repository (Before you are able to push directly to the master on the original repository, I need to add your username to the repo)
6. If your submission breaks the code so it doesn't compile, you will lose all the points of this assignment unless you can recover from this issue before the deadline

## Objective 2
1. Fork the repository into your Github account (DO NOT CLONE THE MAIN REPO)
2. Clone your version of the repository to a local folder\
3. Add a comment or two about other people's favorite quote IN FRONT OF their quote using `/* */` symbols. For example: 
`new UserQuote("Bahram Dahi", "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. - [attributed to] Mark Twain"), /* By John Doe: I think this quote is originally from Grant Allen */`
4. Add, commit to your repository (NOT the main repository). Make sure you pull all changes from upstream before committing.
5. Go to GitHub and do a pull request from your account's repo into master branch of the main repository
